- disallow recursive functions
- factor out viewport <-> screen coordinate transform
- make errors properly display
- remove `constants` and `single_var_functions` from `Interpreter`


- better background grid
- make evaluation (and errors) less dynamically typed
- should juxtaposed multiplication be allowed?
    - function call syntax becomes ambiguous

# far future
- improve the runtime
- better (order independent) name resolution

- sliders
- graphing
- point and list types

- diagnose multiple independent errors at the same time
