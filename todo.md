# notes
- name resolution of global bindings is done on invocation for function bodies

# design
- should juxtaposed multiplication be allowed?
    - function call syntax becomes ambiguous

# far future
- improve the runtime
- better (order independent) name resolution

- sliders
- graphing
- point and list types
    - arglist formatting shouldn't have ()

- diagnose multiple independent errors at the same time
